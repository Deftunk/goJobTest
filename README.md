## Preliminary test
This is the preliminary test in the Gojob recruitment process.
You’ll be asked to develop a little function and to send us the code by mail.

At Gojob we usually use TypeScript, but you can use the language of your choice.
We are convinced that testing is the key to productivity and quality, so if you write some unit tests, join them with the code.

### Closest to zero
Write a function “closestToZero” described by the following specification:

given an array of positive and negative integers, it returns the closest number to zero
if the closest number in input could be either negative or positive, the function returns the positive one
if the input array is undefined or empty, the function returns 0
Examples:

when input is [8, 5, 10] it must returns 5
when input is [5, 4, -9, 6, -10, -1, 8] it must return -1
when input is [8, 2, 3, -2] it must return 2
